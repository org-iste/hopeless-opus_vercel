    { question: "How does the game work?", answer: "The game is designed as a 1-2 player interactive experience where each player's choices directly influence how the story unfolds. Both players will share the same screen, collaborating and competing to shape the narrative." },
    { question: "How do choices affect the game?", answer: "Choices can lead to different outcomes, alter character relationships, and influence the overall narrative direction, creating a unique experience for each player." },
    { question: "Is the game purely focused on making decisions?", answer: "The game includes several mini-games that allow players to score points and perform specific tasks. These mini-games help players pass obstacles and progress further in the game." },
    { question: "What if I get stuck on a puzzle/minigame or decision?", answer: "Depending on the game or choices you get a few tries and on some games there's just one chance. So play wisely!" },
    { question: "What platforms can I play this game on?", answer: "The game is compatible on PC. We suggest players to screencast while playing to get a better experience." },
    { question: "How will the Winner be decided or what are the constraints?", answer: "The game features several constraints that will ultimately determine how players are judged, including time, money, health, and points. Players have a total of three lives, and their choices and performance in mini-games contributes to their overall score." },
    { question: "The game froze. What should I do?", answer: "If the game freezes, refreshing the page or restarting the app usually helps. If issues persist, check your internet connection or clear your browser cache." },
    { question: "How do I track my progress in the story?", answer: "Progress is tracked through a menu, where players can see completed tasks, current challenges, and any unlocked mini-games or story elements." },
